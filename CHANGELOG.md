# Changelog

## 0.4.0

- `planview set` changes statuses and fields in place with one short command, so the agent never rewrites the plan to move a step.
- A shared glossary of about 70 common terms ships with planview; plans only add their own, and the page lists only the terms a plan uses.
- Plans may leave out `views`; each step becomes a lane of a flow picture.
- `poll` prints one compact line per message; `check` caps its warnings.
- Deep links: `&step=`, `&view=`, `&node=` (or `&step=all`) and `&theme=light|dark`.
- Logo, plugin icon and page icon.
- Shorter SKILL.md with a "keep it cheap" section.

## 0.3.0

- Explain mode can point at code: `root` / `roots`, `file:line` and `file:from-to`. `check` fails when a file or line does not exist; the page shows the excerpt and links it to VS Code, Cursor or IntelliJ.
- "ลึกขึ้น" (`deeper`) asks the agent to break a box or stage down further.
- Sequence views frame alternative paths with `group`.
- Sticky status bar; changes stay outlined until acknowledged.
- `poll` ends by itself when the server is stopped.

## 0.2.0

- Explain mode for existing code, with stages, `start` and "เข้าใจเมื่อ".
- Approval before building, teach-back recorded per step (`confirmed`), step `detail` and `done`.
- Chat modes ถาม / ขอแก้ / ทวน on every box, step and the whole plan; unread markers; change highlights; glossary.
- Fixes from four testers: selection kept by id, focus kept while typing, no double sends, one server per folder, safe `stop`, a torn queue line no longer stops the server, byte-safe request bodies.

## 0.1.0

- Plan as `plan.json`, drawn as flow, Kubernetes, sequence and transform pictures.
- Local server with a token, live reload, a durable feedback queue, `poll` and `reply`.
- Packaged as a Claude Code plugin.
